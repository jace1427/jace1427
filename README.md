## About Me

Hello! I am a Software Engineer based out of Seattle, WA. I studied at the University of Oregon, and worked at Microsoft, in the Azure App Services orginization. I took some time off to realign and now I'm looking for new roles! I have experience in AI, webdev, infra, and embedded. Right now I'm mostly looking for embedded roles, but I'm open to anything!
